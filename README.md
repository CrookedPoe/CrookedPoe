# Welcome!
My name is Nick. I'm a motivated and self-driven developer who is passionate about learning and developing my skills.

## About me -- I'm always learning.
For the past twelve years or so, I've learned many skills from reverse engineering--now retro--video games primarily from the late 90's and early 2000's. A prime example are the two Zelda games released on the Nintendo 64. Through this hobby I've learned:
* ðŸ’» General reverse engineering tactics.
* ðŸ’¾ Programming in languages such as C and C#.
* ðŸŒ± How to form thorough and well-documented notes and information.

Not only have I gained skills, but I've also developed a love for writing clean and fluid code with a solid foundation. This structured way of thinking has helped me tackle large tasks in my own life sequentially--like a computer! ðŸ¤–

I'm hoping to be able to use my skills to score myself a career doing what I love to do and hopefully teach some other passionate folks some of what I know while also learning from them.
